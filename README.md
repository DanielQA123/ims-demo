## Inventory Management System (IMS)

Project Description:

The development of a functional application, that uses programming fundamentals such as Java eclipse IDE, MySQL, Git and GitHub. With existing prior knowledge of the listed programming modules, 
to develop a working application that an end user/potential client can interact with via, a Command-Line Interface to input a set of user requirements to get a specific output, related to the user stories. 
Essentially to track inventory levels for orders, customers and items. 
Also, to use unit testing and integration testing to test the code to meet the requirements. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes of the project on the command line. 
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The following software listed are the prerequisites needed to continue work on the project, as well as YouTube tutorials: 

```
* GitHub account created.
* Git software downloaded to the local computer.
* Java with Eclipse downloaded to the local computer.
* MySQL workbench.
* MySQL GCP with a Google Cloud Platform account.

```

### Installing

This is a set of instructions, to install all the prerequisties needed to get a development environment running.  

Say what the step will be

 

```
Give the example
```

 

And repeat

 

```
until finished
```

 

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
